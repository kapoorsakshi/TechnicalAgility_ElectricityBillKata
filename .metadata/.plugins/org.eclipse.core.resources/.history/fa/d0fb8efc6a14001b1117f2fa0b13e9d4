Feature: Calculate electricity bill

  Scenario Outline: calculate Energy Charges Units consumed less or equal to 50 units
    Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    When I check for the energy charges
    Then I verify the <energy charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | energy charge |
      |   40 |           162 |
      |   50 |         202.5 |

  Scenario Outline: calculate Duty Charges Units consumed less or equal to 50 units
    Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    When I check for the energy charges
    Then I verify the <duty charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | duty charge |
      |   40 |         5.2 |
      |   50 |         6.5 |
