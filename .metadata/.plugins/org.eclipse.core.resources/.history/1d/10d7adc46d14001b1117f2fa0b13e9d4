Feature: Calculate electricity bill

  Background: Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
  						And the slab is <slab>

  Scenario Outline: Calculate Energy Charges Units consumed less or equal to 50 units
    When I check for the energy charges
    Then I verify the <energy charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | energy charge |
      |   40 |           162 |
      |   50 |         202.5 |

  Scenario Outline: Calculate FCA Charges Units consumed less or equal to 50 units
    When I check for the FCA charges
    Then I verify the <FCA charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | FCA charge |
      |   40 |        5.2 |
      |   50 |        6.5 |

  Scenario Outline: Calculate Duty Charges Units consumed less or equal to 50 units
    When I check for the slab wise duty charges
    And I check for the FCA on duty charges
    Then I verify the <Total duty charge>

    Examples: 
      | unit | Total duty charge |
      |   40 |               5.2 |
      |   50 |               6.5 |
