Feature: Calculate electricity bill
  
  
   Scenario Outline: calculate Energy Charges Units consumed less or equal to 50 units
    Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    When I check for the energy charges
    Then I verify the <energy charge>

    Examples: 
      |unit| energy charge  |
      | 40 |     162			  | 
      | 50 |    202.5       | 

      
   #Scenario Outline: calculate Energy Charges Units consumed less or equal to 50 units
    #Given My electricity bill is  <unit>
    #When I check for the <energy charges>
    #And I check for t  he <fca charges>
    #And I check for the <duty charges>
    #Then I verify the <Total Bill> in step
